% function model = reconstruct_point_cloud(cam, data)
%
% Method:   Determines the 3D model points by triangulation
%           of a stereo camera system. We assume that the data 
%           is already normalized 
% 
%           Requires that the number of cameras is C=2.
%           Let N be the number of points.
%
% Input:    points2d is a 3xNxC array, storing all image points.
%
%           cameras is a 3x4xC array, where cameras(:,:,1) is the first and 
%           cameras(:,:,2) is the second camera matrix.
% 
% Output:   points3d 4xN matrix of all 3d points.
