% function [cams, cam_centers] = reconstruct_uncalibrated_stereo_cameras(F); 
%
% Method: Calculate the first and second uncalibrated camera matrix
%         from the F-matrix. 
% 
% Input:  F - Fundamental matrix with the last singular value 0 
%
% Output:   cams is a 3x4x2 array, where cams(:,:,1) is the first and 
%           cams(:,:,2) is the second camera matrix.
%
%           cam_centers is a 4x2 array, where (:,1) is the first and (:,2) 
%           the second camera center.
