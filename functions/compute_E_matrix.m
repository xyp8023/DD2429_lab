% function E = compute_E_matrix( points1, points2, K1, K2 );
%
% Method:   Calculate the E matrix between two views from
%           point correspondences: points2^T * E * points1 = 0
%           we use the normalize 8-point algorithm and 
%           enforce the constraint that the three singular 
%           values are: a,a,0. The data will be normalized here. 
%           Finally we will check how good the epipolar constraints:
%           points2^T * E * points1 = 0 are fullfilled.
% 
%           Requires that the number of cameras is C=2.
% 
% Input:    points2d is a 3xNxC array storing the image points.
%
%           K is a 3x3xC array storing the internal calibration matrix for
%           each camera.
%
% Output:   E is a 3x3 matrix with the singular values (a,a,0).
